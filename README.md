# Console Log Element

Firefox Add-on page: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/console-log-element>

Sometimes I wish I could just open the console log right on a mobile device.

This simple add-on enables you to send commands to the console log without having to open the dev tools, even on mobile.

Once installed, click on the add-on icon and button to bring up the interface. You can hit enter to submit, hit the up-arrow to use your previous command, or submit "x" to hide the interface.
